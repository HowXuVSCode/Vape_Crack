# Vape Lite

> I do not promote any kind of cheating. This is just for teaching purposes, If u are gonna use this. Im WARNING you, it is not my fault if u get banned.

Firstly, huge credits to the Kangaroo's team for cracking vape. I have just made new working server

# Vape Server

This is a new updated server that emulates Vape's server based on Kangaroo's crack since the old one wasn't working anymore.

### What works?
- Vape Lite Forge (1.7, 1.8, 1.12)
- Every module
- Saving config
- Editing Profiles
### What doesn't work?
- Lunar client
> If u would like to make it look like u are on Lunar Client, I recommend u getting Lilith. Lilith has Lunar spoofer, so while u are on forge it will show u that u are on Lunar Client. `discord.gg/lilith`
- Vanilla 
> Mapping issue (I'm lazy to fix, since it works on forge)
### How to run it?

#### Server-side
- Get Python3
- Clone this git
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements
- Run `server.py`
- Open Vape folder
- Drag Vape file over the Kangaroo Patcher
- Click Yes
- Enjoy!

### Is this safe?

I'm not entirely sure, I just took Kangaroo's crack. People told it's safe, I cannot confirm anything. Few of my friends have been using it for few weeks, nothing happened so it should be safe.

### Credit
- The Kangaroo Team for the crack and their old server
